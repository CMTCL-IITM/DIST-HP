# DIST-HP
MATLAB codes to read and process the crystal structure file (.xyz format) and calculate the inter/intra-octahedral distortion parameters (Octahedral bond length distortion (Δd), octahedral bond angle variance (𝛔2), and octahedral tilting and rotation angle (𝛳c and 𝛳ab),) in halide perovskites.
